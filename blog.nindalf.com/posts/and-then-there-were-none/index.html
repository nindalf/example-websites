<p>On a meta level, I found the amount of casual racism interesting.

I wonder if we could conclude from this that the average person in the 1930s spoke and thought this way. Also interesting is that this book was originally titled <em>Ten Little Niggers</em>, then re-titled <em>Ten Little Indians</em> (ie, Native Americans), and only later <em>And Then There Were None</em>. This probably reflects the change in society's attitude towards minorities.</p>
