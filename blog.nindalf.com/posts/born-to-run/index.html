<p>The author sets the tone with a clickbait style paragraph ("a beautiful forest ranger who slipped out of her clothes...") and it goes downhill from there. He has an agenda - barefoot running and he pushes with the tried and tested Malcolm Gladwell playbook - deciding a conclusion and then cherry-picking evidence to support it. According to him, barefoot running is the solution to every problem that mankind faces - physical, mental, emotional. There might be some merit to this but the author pushing it so hard leaves a bad taste in my mouth. For the record, there doesn't appear to be conclusive evidence in favor or against barefoot running, but the author doesn't disclose that.</p>
<p>His writing has a host of other issues</p>
<ul>
<li>Unsubtle product placements ("my Victorinox knife", "washed down a ProBar - a chewy raw-food blend of rolled oats, raisins, dates and brown rice syrup", "loaded up with a Cytomax carbohydrate gel"). Its hypocritical because he criticises people for focusing on Nike deals rather than running. Perhaps he could have followed the same advice.</li>
<li>Lack of regard for proofreading ("she could care less")</li>
<li>Preference for telling rather than demonstrating ("his head was a Library of Congress of running lore")</li>
<li>Propensity to make shit up (he claims that chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov once gifted a queen to psych his opponent out)</li>
<li>Tendency to take cheap shots at people (he criticises the co-founder of Nike and former Olympic track coach in many ways, almost none of which are well founded)</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost all of the people in this book are officious, loud and annoying. Reading about them was a hard slog for me, though I'm willing to concede that this is personal taste. Others might find it bearable.</p>
<p>I would not recommend this book.</p>
